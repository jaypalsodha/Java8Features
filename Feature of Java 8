1. Lambda Expression:- 
	defination:- It is an anonymous function. 
		- nameless
		- without return type
		- without modifier

	benefits:- It is used to enable functional programming.

	let see how to write lambda expression:-

	suppose we have an method

	public void doSomething()
	{
		System.out.println("hello");
	}

	As per the defination lambda expression doesn't contains name, return type and modifier. 

	so just remove all these things from above method. 

	()
	{
		System.out.println("hello");	
	}

	to represent lambda expression they provide one special symbol called -> (arrow) is used.

	() ->
	{
		System.out.println("hello");	
	}

	here, curly braces is the body of an method.

	() ->{System.out.println("hello");}

	If method body contains only one line of code, then {} becomes optional.
